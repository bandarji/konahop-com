							<p><b>County Orders Vacation Rentals, B&Bs, Time-Shares to Cease Operations during COVID-19 Emergency​</b></p>
<p>Aloha.</p>

<p>The County of Hawai‘i has ordered vacation rentals, bed and breakfasts and time shares to cease operations and advertising during the period specified in Governor Ige’s Emergency Proclamations. The order, the Mayor’s COVID-19 Emergency Rule #1, is effective Monday, April 13, 2020 at 12:01 a.m. and will continue throughout the COVID-19 emergency, or until terminated sooner by the Mayor’s Order.</p>

<p>Under the Governor’s Third Supplementary Proclamation issued on March 23, 2020, hotels and motels used for lodging and delivering or carry-out food services, were identified as essential businesses. “Bed and Breakfasts, short-term rentals and time-shares were not identified as essential businesses or operations under the Governor’s Third Supplementary Proclamation,” the Mayor’s Rule said.</p>

<p>“The bed and breakfasts, short-term rentals and time-shares are spread out throughout the island, with many of them within residential communities, and many of their occupants, who are visitors, possibly not complying with the Governor’s Proclamations to self-quarantine for fourteen days at their place of stay,” the rule said. “Therefore, all of these specified businesses or operations, including advertising, must cease for the period specified in the Governor’s Proclamation,” the rule said.</p>

<p>Kona House of Palms will comply with the order. We shall not accommodate guests during this emergency. We look forward inviting guests again soon. Mahalo nui loa.</p>
